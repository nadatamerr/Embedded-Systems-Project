# Embedded-Systems-Project
Car Auto Parking System
This project automates the car parking system with a help of Embedded system concepts. 

## Motivation 
The problem we are trying to tackle is the struggle people face when parking their cars. Other than trying to find an empty parking spot, the driver will then try to imagine whether or not their car will fit in this specific spot. After that, they will start to position the car correctly to begin reversing into the parking space to finally park. Throughout this whole process, there are other cars that have been blocked by this person trying to park. In addition, for beginners especially, crashing the car into a parked car is a high possibility. Therefore, parking assistance mechanisms were introduced. such as parking sensors, rear cameras and finally auto parking. Auto parking is the ultimate solution for this issue, as it optimizes the whole parking process and alleviates the stress and responsibility off of the vehicle driver. Although parking sensors and cameras are very common now, only a few car manufacturers have implemented the auto-parking feature.
